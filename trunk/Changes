   Version 1.1.0        2011-09-09
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Changes:
  o Added documentation source to distribution.
  o Added ringbuffer implementation for ringbuffer logging.
  o Added check for logger type before setting file or ringbuffer, new
    error code LOG_ERR_WRONG_TYPE is returned if fails.
 Bugfixes:
  o Content of logfile was not written until program ends successfully
    (logger was successfully removed/file closed). Added flush to force
    write of content in file during runtime.

   Version 1.0.0        2010-03-28
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Changes:
  o Removed compiler flag -Werror because it is not practical, each new
    compiler version could break the releases.
  o Added more checks in configure.
  o Moved all log functions to own source code files to avoid
    unreferenced functions in object files and reduce the size.

 Bugfixes:
  o Fixed compiler warnings from gcc version 4.4.1
  o Fixed buffer overflow if log functions are called with a varying
    number of arguments.
